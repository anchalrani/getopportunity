Those who are candidates for Government Jobs (Sarkari Naukri) and applying for various Government job vacancy notifications, know that an application fee is generally asked with most of the vacancy notifications. If application is offline, then candidates have to submits applications mostly by Bank DD / Indian Postal Order and send it with applications itself and in the case of online submission of application, fee is submitted online by online means or by payment challan in a bank.

Now, it is being observed that this application fee is now increased many times. In one case of some advertisement by MP Government, a whopping application fee of Rs.5000/- was asked where is in some cases of Rajasthan Government and Central PSU companies, application fee was asked Rs. 3000/-. Generally now days fee of Rs. 1000/- and Rs.1500/- has become norm. Only Public Service Commissions (PSC) are charging Rs. 100-300 per application.  

Fee is generally asked for General and OBC category  male candidates only. SC, ST, PwD candidates are either asked for 50% of the fee or exempted from payment of the fee. Women (female) candidates are now exempted from payment of application fee.  Minorities are exempted from the application fee in some states and in Indian Railways only.

Generally those who are applying to the Government vacancies are from middle class or from economically weaker section of the society. Therefore increase in the application fee is pinching the parents of the candidates as it is the parent of the candidates who are paying this fee.

Either this application fee increase should be reduced or it should be abolished for all candidates as most of the candidates are not from economically well to do families.
